# c9.ide.language.javascript.eslintd

An ESLint plugin for Cloud9 IDE that makes use of [eslint_d](https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js) for lightening fast full featured javascript linting.

The default linter in Cloud9 IDE uses a browser copy of eslint that does not support parsers or plug-ins in the way you might expect and does not work with the likes of the popular [airbnb config](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). This plug-in uses [eslint_d](https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js) to eliminate the node.js startup time along with the netcat abilities to lint your code in ~100ms on the Cloud9 server using the standard eslint cli for full feature support.

## Installation

Install the plug-in by adding it to your plug-in directory by running the following commands from the IDE terminal.

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.c9/plugins
$ cd ~/.c9/plugins
$ git clone https://github.com/michaelmitchell/c9.ide.language.javascript.eslintd.git
```

This plug-in expects [eslint_d](https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js) to be installed in `~/.c9/node_modules`. Run the following commands in the IDE terminal to install it in the right place.

```sh
$ cd ~/.c9
$ npm install eslint_d
```

Load the plug-in from your Init Script from `Cloud9 > Open Your Init Script menu` inside of the IDE. Take a look at the [SDK docs](https://cloud9-sdk.readme.io/docs/customizing-cloud9#section-installing-packages) for more details.

```js
// You can access plugins via the 'services' global variable
/*global services, plugin*/

// to load plugins use
// services.pluginManager.loadPackage([
//     "https://<user>.github.io/<project>/build/package.<name>.js",
//     "~/.c9/plugins/<name>/package.json",
// ]);

services.pluginManager.loadPackage([
    "~/.c9/plugins/c9.ide.language.javascript.eslintd/package.json"
]);
```

## Usage

The plug-in starts [eslint_d](https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js) when the IDE loads but can take a couple of seconds to initialize, after it is running you should see the correct linting errors according to your [.eslintrc](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-file-formats) as if you were to run it from the command line, proceeding changes to editor markers should be reflected quickly as you change your code.

**The plugin will not function if no [.eslintrc](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-file-formats) is present so be sure to add one even if it is blank.**
